# form-nodejs-mongodb
Created a simple form using html that will save user data to server implemented in Node.js with MongoDB database and allow us to see saved data on a separate page in JSON format.

1.Firstly,i have installed the mongoDB server for my macOS.
2.Then installed some required packages to use nodeJS like,
      Express - popular web framework;
      body-parser - body parser middleware, allows to access req.body property;
      mongodb - MongoDB driver for Node.js
In the command line i used following commands to install these packages:
npm init -y
npm i --save express body-parser mongodb

3.Then created a basic user response form using html.
4.Created a connection between serve static and database.

Thank You sir/madam for giving me this wonderful task :)
